## 2. General notes

This document contains search strings for finding publications related to the actions in the SDG 1 targets and indicators ("action approach"; focus on precision, smaller result set). We also have a version which finds publications related to the topics in the SDG 1 targets and indicators ("topic approach"; focus on recall, larger result set), provided in the same repository as this file. For more explanation, see the Readme in this repository.

Targets and Indicators were found from the UN Statistics Division (<a id="SDGT+Is">[UN Statistics Division, 2021](#f1)</a>). This list includes "the global indicator framework as contained in A/RES/71/313, the refinements agreed by the Statistical Commission at its 49th session in March 2018 (E/CN.3/2018/2, Annex II) and 50th session in March 2019 (E/CN.3/2019/2, Annex II), changes from the 2020 Comprehensive Review (E/CN.3/2020/2, Annex II) and refinements (E/CN.3/2020/2, Annex III) from the 51st session in March 2020, and refinements from the 52nd session in March 2021 (E/CN.3/2021/2, Annex)". (https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/indicators-list/).

Our classification of countries as least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS) and landlocked developing states (LDS) is taken from the Statistical Annex of United Nations World Economic Situation and Prospects (tables F, H and I) (<a id="UNLDCs">[United Nations, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021](#f3)</a>). Additional terms for these countries, generic terms for country groups, and terms for low and middle income countries (LMICs) were gathered from the LMIC 2020 filter from the Norwegian Satellite of Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC), developed by the Norwegian Institute of Public Heath (https://epoc.cochrane.org/lmic-filters).

During editing of this string (2021), we have also consulted of queries from the <a id="Aurora">[Aurora Universities network (2020)](#f29)</a>

## 3. Targets

### Target 1.1

> **1.1 By 2030, eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently measured as people living on less than $1.25 a day**
>
> 1.1.1 Proportion of the population living below the international poverty line by sex, age, employment status and geographic location (urban/rural)

This target is interpreted as to cover research about eradication/reduction of extreme poverty. Here we consider relevance limited to research about absolute poverty, vs. target 1.2 which is about poverty generally.

This query consists of 1 phrase. The basic structure is *extreme/global poverty + action*.

`(("liv*" OR "surviv*" ) NEAR/5 "$1.25 "))` was taken out as adds irrelevant hits (picks up random numbers from abstracts). `international poverty` will cover international poverty line. `global poverty` is a slightly messy term which gives many relevant but some less relevant results, but is the term used by the World Bank who are the custodians of 1.1 and set the limit of $1.25 ($2.15 as of Sep 2022) for the global poverty line (<a id="globalpoverty">[World Bank, 2022](#f16)</a>).

TS=

  ("extreme poverty" OR "severe poverty" OR "deep poverty" OR "abject poverty" OR "absolute poverty" OR "destitution"
  OR "global poverty" OR "international poverty"

    ("decreas*" OR "minimi*" OR "reduc*" OR "mitigat*"
    OR "alleviat*" OR "tackl*" OR "fight*" OR "combat*"

    OR "lift out of" OR "lifting out of" OR "overcom*" OR "escap*" OR "relief"
    )
)  
```

### Target 1.2

> **1.2 By 2030, reduce at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions**
>
> 1.2.1 Proportion of population living below the national poverty line, by sex and age
>
> 1.2.2 Proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions

This target is interpreted as to cover research about poverty reduction. 

Research about `decent work` was considered for inclusion, as this is highlighted as a route out of poverty in the High level political forum document <a id="HLPF2017">([UN 2017](#f2))</a>. However we have not included it - it is not necessarily linked to poverty, and articles linking this topic with poverty reduction can be expected to be covered by the phrase below.

This query consists of 1 phrase. The general structure is *poverty + action*

This string originally also contained terminology around the words "poor" and "poorest" (e.g. "poor families"). However, this is here taken out of the *action* approach - many results were not necessarily directly related to reducing poverty. For example, many results were about about access to services for poor communities, which is covered in a later target. In addition, `the poor` is a difficult phrase - it is used often in a poverty context (perhaps more historically), but is also part of very common sentence structure ("the poor uptake of micronutrients..."). These terms are therefore included in the *topic approach* only. 

```py
TS=
(
  "anti-poverty" OR "antipoverty" OR "out of poverty"
  OR
  (
    ("poverty")
    NEAR/5
        ("decreas*" OR "minimi*" OR "reduc*" OR "mitigat*"
        OR "alleviat*" OR "tackl*" OR "fight*" OR "combat*"
        OR "end" OR "ending" OR "eliminat*" OR "eradicat*" OR "prevent*"
        OR "lift out of" OR "lifting out of" OR "overcom*" OR "escap*" OR "relief"
        )
  )
) 
```


### Target 1.3

> **1.3 Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable**
>
> 1.3.1 Proportion of population covered by social protection floors/systems, by sex, distinguishing children, unemployed persons, older persons, persons with disabilities, pregnant women, newborns, work-injury victims and the poor and the vulnerable

This target is interpreted to cover research about:
- establishment/implementation of social protection systems and social floors
- improving access to/coverage of social protection systems and social floors

To aid interpretation of "social protection" and find terms, we used a guide to terminology and types from the Governance and Social Development Resource Centre <a id="gsdrc">([Carter et al. 2019](#f9))</a>. We interpreted social floors according to the ILO, as including basic health care and basic income security for certain groups (children, elderly, unemployed or unable to work) <a id="socialfloors">([International Labour Organization n.d.](#f5))</a>.

This query consists of 2 phrases. Some of the terms for services/systems work well without groups of people (phrase 1), but some need to be combined with "the poor and the vulnerable" to get relevant results (phrase 2).

#### Phrase 1

This phrase is about access to, coverage of and establishment of floors/protection systems/welfare systems. The basic structure is *action + social protection systems*.

As most of the *social protection* terms include a systemic element (systems, services) they do not need to be combined with groups of people. `social assistance` seems to work better alone - works were missed when combined with `services`. `welfare state` was considered but excluded as it leads mostly to papers about early welfare states and the history of those.

      OR "social safety net$" OR "safety net program*"
      )
)
```  


#### Phrase 2

This phrase is also about social floors and systems, but includes the terms which work better when combined with groups of people. The basic structure is *action + social protection/social floors + poor/vulnerable*.

For the *poor and vulnerable* terms, we use general terms for poverty/low income, plus terms for "vulnerable" groups from indicator 1.3.1. We used UN sources to find additional terms and groups that can be considered "vulnerable" (<a id="Blanchard">[Blanchard et al., 2017](#f12)</a>; <a id="UNOHC">[Office of the High Commissioner, n.d.](#f13)</a>; <a id="UNracism">[United Nations, n.d.](#f14)</a>). `"social care service$"` are sometimes considered a part of social protection <a id="gsdrc">([Carter et al. 2019](#f9))</a> - we there include social care services here, although they do introduce noise as there are works which mention them as a factor (e.g. a health study that discusses whether participants had access to social care).

### Target 1.4

> **1.4 By 2030, ensure that all men and women, in particular the poor and the vulnerable, have equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to basic services, ownership and control over land and other forms of property, inheritance, natural resources, appropriate new technology and financial services, including microfinance**
>
> 1.4.1 Proportion of population living in households with access to basic services
>
> 1.4.2 Proportion of total adult population with secure tenure rights to land, (a) with legally recognized documentation, and (b) who perceive their rights to land as secure, by sex and type of tenure

This target is interpreted to cover research about the "poor and the vulnerable" and:
* Ensuring access and rights to financial services ("financial inclusion"). We interpret this as money-based resources. For this we include research about access to forms of microfinance, digital finance and mobile money, plus other more traditional financial products/financial services. Includes credit, savings, payment services, fund transfers and insurance.
* Ensuring access and rights to economic resources and land/property/inheritance/natural resources (including rights for tenure, ownership and control, and security). We interpret "economic resources" to include mentioned elements such as land, natural resources and technology, but could also include human capital/labour (e.g. access to employment).
* Ensuring access and rights to basic services

We based this interpretation of financial and economic resources on <a id="DESA">[Department of Economic and Social Affairs (2009)](#f7)</a> (p1), which states:
> Economic resources refer to the direct factors of production such as “immoveable” assets, including land, housing, common pool resources and infrastructure, as well as “moveable” assets, such as productive equipment, technology and livestock. Financial resources refer to money-based resources, including government expenditures, private financial flows and official development assistance, as well as income, credit, savings and remittances. [...] Labour is the primary resource available to the vast majority of people, particularly
those from low-income households [...]

Although the target states for "all men and women", we target the search to this SDG by combining the phrases also to an element about "the poor and the vulnerable". We do this because a) some of the search terms are quite general (for example, appear in general economic research), and b) because other SDGs refer to access to specific basic services (e.g. modern energy in SDG 7, essential healthcare in SDG 3); thus we assume that the most relevant research for this target should also be somewhat related to poverty/poor/vulnerable. For the *poor and vulnerable* terms, we use general terms for poverty/low income, plus terms for "vulnerable" groups from indicator 1.3.1. We used UN sources to find additional terms and groups that can be considered "vulnerable" (<a id="Blanchard">[Blanchard et al., 2017](#f12)</a>; <a id="UNOHC">[Office of the High Commissioner, n.d.](#f13)</a>; <a id="UNracism">[United Nations, n.d.](#f14)</a>). We include least developed countries also (on the assumption that the population there as a whole can, on a global scale, be considered poorer or more vulnerable).  

#### Phrase 1
This phrase covers ensuring access and rights to financial services. The basic structure is *action + access/rights + financial services + poor/vulnerable*.

Sources of terms for *financial services* included <a id="DESA">[Department of Economic and Social Affairs (2009)](#f7)</a> and a digital financial inclusion report from the <a id="sgsa">[UNSGSA et al. (2018)](#f8)</a>.

#### Phrase 3

Phrase 3 covers access to basic services. The basic structure is *action + access + basic services + poor/vulnerable*.

*Basic services* terms were gathered from documentation for indicator 1.4.1 in the SDG Indicators Metadata Repository (<a id="SDGmetarep">[UN Statistics Division, 2022](#f11)</a>) and a presentation from UNESCAP/UN Habitat (<a id="UNhabitat">[Njiru, 2018](#f15)</a>). `basic NEAR services` is used to allow e.g. "basic sanitation services".

### Target 1.5

> **1.5 By 2030, build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters**
>
> 1.5.1 Number of deaths, missing persons and directly affected persons attributed to disasters per 100,000 population
>
> 1.5.2 Direct economic loss attributed to disasters in relation to global gross domestic product (GDP)
>
> 1.5.3 Number of countries that adopt and implement national disaster risk reduction strategies in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030
>
> 1.5.4 Proportion of local governments that adopt and implement local disaster risk reduction strategies in line with national disaster risk reduction strategies

This target is interpreted to cover research about improving the resilience and reducing impacts of disasters for the poor and those in vulnerable situations. This includes works about establishment of disaster plans, and about social safety nets and disasters. We consider "climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters" to cover all kinds of disasters.

The target is limited to "the poor and those in vulnerable situations". For the *poor and vulnerable* terms, we use general terms for poverty/low income, plus terms for "vulnerable" groups from indicator 1.3.1. We used UN sources to find additional terms and groups that can be considered "vulnerable" (<a id="Blanchard">[Blanchard et al., 2017](#f12)</a>; <a id="UNOHC">[Office of the High Commissioner, n.d.](#f13)</a>; <a id="UNracism">[United Nations, n.d.](#f14)</a>). We have also included least-developed countries, small-island developing states and group-terms for developing countries, based on the assumption that these populations may be considered more vulnerable when it comes to disasters. `social capital` is also included as a term in this section - while this term does not correspond directly to *poor and vulnerable*, works using this term often refer to relevant populations. 

We have used the hazards listed in <a id="disasters">[Murray et al., (2021)](#f4)</a> to make a list of disasters based on their classification of hazards into hydrological/meteorological, geohazards, environmental, chemical, biological, technological, and societal.

This query consists of 1 phrase. The basic structure is *action + disaster + poor/vulnerable*.

### Target 1.a

> **1.a Ensure significant mobilization of resources from a variety of sources, including through enhanced development cooperation, in order to provide adequate and predictable means for developing countries, in particular least developed countries, to implement programmes and policies to end poverty in all its dimensions.**
>
> 1.a.1 Total official development assistance grants from all donors that focus on poverty reduction as a share of the recipient country’s gross national income
>
> 1.a.2 Proportion of total government spending on essential services (education, health and social protection)

This target is interpreted to cover research about investment in and cooperation for poverty eradication in developing countries. We do not include individual flows of money (e.g. remittances) in this interpretation. This query consists of 1 phrase. The basic structure is *financing/cooperation + anti-poverty + developing countries*. Note that this phrase does not contain an action element as it was considered too restrictive.

`FDI` refers to "foreign direct investment". Using `"UN" OR "europe*" OR "pacific" OR "asia$" OR "africa$" OR "latin america$" OR "*arctic"` as terms for international (in `"international" OR "development" OR "foreign"`) was tested, but mostly resulted in noise from South Africa.

### Target 1.b

> **1.b Create sound policy frameworks at the national, regional and international levels, based on pro-poor and gender-sensitive development strategies, to support accelerated investment in poverty eradication actions**
>
> 1.b.1 Pro-poor public social spending

This target is about policies that can stimulate investment in antipoverty actions, however, we interpret it more widely to cover **research about policies and poverty reduction**. This is because "policies for investment" is very difficult to build a search string for, as the terms can be used for more than one aspect (e.g. policy to encourage investment in anti-poverty actions, investment in anti-poverty policies). 

The general structure is *policy + antipoverty*. Note that this phrase does not contain an action element as it was considered too restrictive.
