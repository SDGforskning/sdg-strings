## 2. General notes

This document contains search strings for finding publications related to the actions in the SDG 9 targets and indicators ("action approach"; focus on precision, smaller result set). We also have a version which finds publications related to the topics in the SDG 9 targets and indicators ("topic approach"; focus on recall, larger result set), provided in the same repository as this file. For more explanation, see the Readme in this repository.

Targets and Indicators were found from the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs website <a href="#f1">(UN DESA, 2025)</a>.

Our classification of countries as least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS) and landlocked developing states (LDS) is taken from the Statistical Annex of United Nations World Economic Situation and Prospects (tables F, H and I) <a href="#f2">(United Nations, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021)</a>. Additional terms for these countries, generic terms for country groups, and terms for low and middle income countries (LMICs) were gathered from the LMIC 2020 filter from the Norwegian Satellite of Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC), developed by the Norwegian Institute of Public Heath (https://epoc.cochrane.org/lmic-filters).


## 3. Targets

### Target 9.1

> **9.1 Develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, including regional and transborder infrastructure, to support economic development and human well-being, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all**
>
> 9.1.1 Proportion of the rural population who live within 2 km of an all-season road
>
> 9.1.2 Passenger and freight volumes, by mode of transport

This target is interpreted to cover research about 

* Creating and improving quality, reliable, environmentally sustainable and resilient infrastructure to support economic development and human well-being.
* Constructing and developing local and cross-border infrastructure solutions, such as transportation networks.
* Developing infrastructure solutions that are accessible, equitable and affordable for all.

This target talks about the comprehensive development of functional and sustainable infrastructure. The infrastructure being developed should support equitable economic progress and social development. At the same time, it should be environmentally responsible and foster global cooperation.

Target is closely related to SDG 3.6 and SDG 11.2. (“Some SDGs are directly connected to sustainable transport through targets and indicators, such as SDG 3.6 on road safety, SDG 9.1 on infrastructure, and SDG 11.2 on providing access to safe, affordable, accessible, and sustainable transport systems for all and expanding public transport.” /United Nations. Sustainable transport, sustainable development. Interagency report for second Global Sustainable Transport Conference. 2021.)

### Target 9.2

> **9.2 Promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and, by 2030, significantly raise industry’s share of employment and gross domestic product, in line with national circumstances, and double its share in least developed countries**
>
> 9.2.1 Manufacturing value added as a proportion of GDP and per capita
>
> 9.2.2 Manufacturing employment as a proportion of total employment

This target is interpreted to cover research about 

* Inclusive industrialization, ensuring that the benefits of industrial development are shared beyond the privileged people and regions.
* Promotion of sustainable industrialization, advancing environmentally friendly industrialization that utilizes clean technologies, minimizes pollution and emissions, and avoids overconsumption of resources.
* Increasing the share of industry in both GDP and employment, based on the idea that industry can drive productivity and raise living standards.

This target is based on the idea of economic structural transformation, recognizing that development requires a shift from agriculture-based economies toward industrial and service sectors. It also acknowledges that industrial production has been concentrated in wealthy countries and aims to distribute it more equitably across the world.

### Target 9.3

> **9.3 Increase the access of small-scale industrial and other enterprises, in particular in developing countries, to financial services, including affordable credit, and their integration into value chains and markets**
>
> 9.3.1 Proportion of small-scale industries in total industry value added
>
> 9.3.2 Proportion of small-scale industries with a loan or line of credit

This target is interpreted to cover research about 

* Improving access to financial services for all types of small-scale industrial and other enterprises, with financial services referring to, for example, affordable credit.
* Integrating small-scale industrial and other enterprises into value chains (production and distribution chains) and into local and international markets.

The target is based on the idea of entrepreneurship as a development policy; supporting small enterprises promotes employment, innovation, and economic activity, especially in developing countries.

>
> 9.4.1 CO2 emission per unit of value added

This target is interpreted to cover research about 

* Modernizing or upgrading infrastructure and industry to ensure sustainability, with attention to efficient resource use and improved utilization of raw materials and water.
* Adoption of environmentally friendly and low-pollution technologies, such as renewable energy, recycling, and low-emission production.

### Target 9.5

> **9.5 Enhance scientific research, upgrade the technological capabilities of industrial sectors in all countries, in particular developing countries, including, by 2030, encouraging innovation and substantially increasing the number of research and development workers per 1 million people and public and private research and development spending**
>
> 9.5.1 Research and development expenditure as a proportion of GDP
>
> 9.5.2 Researchers (in full-time equivalent) per million inhabitants

### Target 9.c

> **9.c Significantly increase access to information and communications technology and strive to provide universal and affordable access to the Internet in least developed countries by 2020**
>
> 9.c.1 Proportion of population covered by a mobile network, by technology
> 
This target is interpreted to cover research about 

* Increasing access to information and communication technology in least development countries
* Providing universal and affordable access to Internet in least development countries 

In most developing countries, mobile broadband (3G or above) is the main way – and often the only way – to connect to the Internet. Around 95 per cent of the global population now has this form of access. Bridging the “coverage gap” for the remaining 5 per cent poses significant challenges. Mobile broadband remains inaccessible to 18 per cent of people in the LDCs and LLDCs. https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2024/
