## 2. General notes

This document contains search strings for finding publications related to the actions in the SDG 9 targets and indicators ("action approach"; focus on precision, smaller result set). We also have a version which finds publications related to the topics in the SDG 9 targets and indicators ("topic approach"; focus on recall, larger result set), provided in the same repository as this file. For more explanation, see the Readme in this repository.

Targets and Indicators were found from the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs website <a href="#f1">(UN DESA, 2025)</a>.

Our classification of countries as least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS) and landlocked developing states (LDS) is taken from the Statistical Annex of United Nations World Economic Situation and Prospects (tables F, H and I) <a href="#f2">(United Nations, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021)</a>. Additional terms for these countries, generic terms for country groups, and terms for low and middle income countries (LMICs) were gathered from the LMIC 2020 filter from the Norwegian Satellite of Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC), developed by the Norwegian Institute of Public Heath (https://epoc.cochrane.org/lmic-filters).


## 3. Targets

### Target 9.1

> **9.1 Develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, including regional and transborder infrastructure, to support economic development and human well-being, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all**
>
> 9.1.1 Proportion of the rural population who live within 2 km of an all-season road
>
> 9.1.2 Passenger and freight volumes, by mode of transport

This target is interpreted to cover research about developing reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure that is accessible for all. 

Infrastructure is understood in this target as a broad and integrated system, consisting of both physical and institutional components. It includes so-called hard infrastructure, such as energy, transport, water, waste management and digital communication systems, as well as soft infrastructure, including human resources, institutional structures and policy frameworks. (Soriano, A., Gaikwad. S., Stratton-Short. S., Bajpai, A, & Imbuye. J. 2022, 10; United Nations Environment Programme 2021, 8).

Sustainable infrastructure refers to systems that are planned, designed, built, operated, and eventually decommissioned in ways that ensure economic, financial, social, environmental (including climate resilience), and institutional sustainability throughout their entire life cycle. This widely used definition is adapted from the Inter-American Development Bank. (United Nations Environment Programme (2021) 2021, 8).

### Target 9.2

> **9.2 Promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and, by 2030, significantly raise industry’s share of employment and gross domestic product, in line with national circumstances, and double its share in least developed countries**
>
> 9.2.1 Manufacturing value added as a proportion of GDP and per capita
>
> 9.2.2 Manufacturing employment as a proportion of total employment

This target is interpreted to cover research about 

* Promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization.
* Increasing share of industry in both gross domestic product (GDP) and employment. 

This target is based on the idea of economic structural transformation, recognizing that development requires a shift from agriculture-based economies toward industrial and service sectors. It also acknowledges that industrial production has been concentrated in wealthy countries and aims to distribute it more equitably across the world.

>
> 9.3.1 Proportion of small-scale industries in total industry value added
>
> 9.3.2 Proportion of small-scale industries with a loan or line of credit

This target is interpreted to cover research about 

* Improving access to financial services for all types of small-scale industrial and other enterprises, with financial services referring to, for example, affordable credit.
* Integrating small-scale industrial and other enterprises into value chains (production and distribution chains) and into local and international markets.

### Target 9.4

> **9.4 By 2030, upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries to make them sustainable, with increased resource-use efficiency and greater adoption of clean and environmentally sound technologies and industrial processes, with all countries taking action in accordance with their respective capabilities**
>
> 9.4.1 CO2 emission per unit of value added

This target is interpreted to cover research about 

* Modernizing or upgrading infrastructure and industry to ensure sustainability, with attention to efficient resource use and improved utilization of raw materials and water.
* Adoption of environmentally friendly and low-pollution technologies, such as renewable energy, recycling, and low-emission production.

### Target 9.5

> **9.5 Enhance scientific research, upgrade the technological capabilities of industrial sectors in all countries, in particular developing countries, including, by 2030, encouraging innovation and substantially increasing the number of research and development workers per 1 million people and public and private research and development spending**
>
> 9.5.1 Research and development expenditure as a proportion of GDP
>
> 9.5.2 Researchers (in full-time equivalent) per million inhabitants

This target is interpreted to cover research about 

* Enhancing/increasing scientific research,  
* Upgrading technological capabilities of industrial sectors 
* (encouraging innovation, increasing research and development workers, increasing public and private funding/investing) 

SDG Target 9.5 focuses on strengthening the foundation for innovation and scientific advancement. E-Handbook on Sustainable Development Goals Indicators (2024): 9.5.1 and 9.5.2. In spite of the research workforce continuing to rise at the global level, firm policy commitments towards substantial increase in the number of research personnel, particularly in developing economies, as well as strengthening the participation of women in research profession are essential for the effective delivery of innovative solutions for the challenges ahead.

### Target 9.c

> **9.c Significantly increase access to information and communications technology and strive to provide universal and affordable access to the Internet in least developed countries by 2020**
>
> 9.c.1 Proportion of population covered by a mobile network, by technology
> 
This target is interpreted to cover research about 

* Increasing access to information and communication technology in least development countries
* Providing universal and affordable access to Internet in least development countries 

In most developing countries, mobile broadband (3G or above) is the main way – and often the only way – to connect to the Internet. Around 95 per cent of the global population now has this form of access. Bridging the “coverage gap” for the remaining 5 per cent poses significant challenges. Mobile broadband remains inaccessible to 18 per cent of people in the LDCs and LLDCs. https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2024/
