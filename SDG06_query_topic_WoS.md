## 2. General notes

This document contains search strings for finding publications related to the topics in the SDG 6 targets and indicators ("topic approach"; focus on recall, larger result set). We also have a version which finds publications related to the actions in the SDG 6 targets and indicators ("action approach"; focus on precision, smaller result set), provided in the same repository as this file. For more explanation, see the Readme in this repository.

Targets and Indicators were found from the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs website <a href="#f1">(UN DESA, 2025)</a>.

Our classification of countries as least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS) and landlocked developing states (LDS) is taken from the Statistical Annex of United Nations World Economic Situation and Prospects (tables F, H and I) <a href="#f2">(United Nations, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021)</a>. Additional terms for these countries, generic terms for country groups, and terms for low and middle income countries (LMICs) were gathered from the LMIC 2020 filter from the Norwegian Satellite of Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC), developed by the Norwegian Institute of Public Heath (https://epoc.cochrane.org/lmic-filters).

## 3. Targets

### Target 6.1

> **6.1 By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all**
>
> 6.1.1 Proportion of population using safely managed drinking water services

This target is interpreted to cover research about 

#### Phrase 1

This phrase aims to find research about accessibility to safe and affordable drinking water and about investing in safely managed drinking water services and infrastructures. By the definition of the indicator metadata 6.1.1 safely managed drinking water services refer to using `improved drinking water sources` which are accessible, available when needed and free from contamination. The indicator metadata definitions for accessability and availability would have been difficult to incorporate in the phrase, we have just search for any research mentioning accessable or available drinking water.

Terms for improved drinking water sources were found from the indicator 6.1.1 metadata https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-06-01-01.pdf.  (“UNstats2025”).

The elements of the phrase are *access/availability/affordability/management/regulation/investment + safe/improved + drinking water*
